### 1. Blood Spatter Tracker <br>
   The Blood Spatter Tracker is a WIP project I recently embarked on, combining my interest in forensics with my interest in engineering and computing. The idea is to create a program that is able to, from a picture taken of 1 or many blood spatters in a crime scene, reconstruct and visualise the likely points of origin of the blood, and visualise this in a 3D space using Artificial Reality(AR) technology. This serves as a substitute for/supplement to traditional blood stringing, which is time-inefficient, manpower resource-heavy, and subject to human error. The orientation of the blood spatters is detected by fiducial markers, commonly used in AR applications. Currently, I have developed the code for transforming a picture of a bloodstain taken at an angle to a 2D one, as well as the code to detect an assumed elliptical blood droplet, and calculate the predicted droplet trajectory. 
   
  Within this folder is:
  - Initial Plan Picture (Taken from a presentation I did)
  - Current Literature on the subject and existing products
  - 2D to 3D transformation code (based on AR methods)
  - Trajectory calculator
  
  I hope to work more on this and finish it in the future.

### 2. Physics Performance Task <br>
   This Physics Performance Task submission is one that took up a large portion of my heart and soul. Though the requirements of the task only required that we design a few sailboats and test their speed by measuring the time it took to travel a set distance, one complication that I struggled with was that the angle of the wind with respect to the boat's intended direction of travel was not specified. This was especially vexxing, especially for me, as I had wanted to investigate the optimal sail angles, which would be entirely contingent on the direction of aforementioned headwind. As such, I was forced to develop "Indirect Testing Methods", such as a home-built wind tunnel and a device that dragged the boat through water in order to get quantitative data for this project. Additionally, instead of a singular solution to the question "what is the optimal sail angle?", my component presented a function/program as the solution, which would give the optimal angle for any given wind angle. 
   Within this folder is:
   - Oral Presentation
   - Final Report
   
   This project holds a special place in my heart due to the effort I put into it.
